You need good local knowledge.\r\n  \r\n  Heavy take off which then rifles off down the line like a runnaway freight train, make sure you got a few surfs under your belt before surfing here once it hits the 4ft + mark otherwise you could get hurt. I also seriously advise taking a first aid kit on board with you as it breaks over shallow reef and reef gashes are not uncommon. <br><br>when it breaks its good...when that is...trying to get right wind right tide and swell..hmmmm don''t let anybody bullshit you you gotta have luck..one other kak surfspot near by jellybabies..names says it all  soft and mushy\r\n  \r\n  I disagree, you don''t need luck you need knowledge and a good logistic .. I see crew heading out there when I''m heading for the hills .. they don''t know what they''re doing and thats why they miss out. Like I said earlier it''s all about winds, tides, and swell direction, once you got it wired it''s like reading a book! Anyway if anyone wants any advice feel free to give me a yell, I live here! ... lamoucate'),

In small surf it is normally very busy, you need to show the same respect as you would at your home break - There are locals, some with bad attitudes, but if you hold back you will not get any waves. There can be a hundred people in the water on an offshore 4 foot day, in which case you have to hassle a bit. When it is 6 foot and over the &quot;Bad Boy&quot; locals stay on the pier. You must ride a gun on low tide as it gets very hollow and fast with some waves offering more than one barrel, on high tide you can still ride a short board on the medium big days and will be able to do big carves!

I do not surf here anymore as I am in my mid 40''s and have mellowed out, but for young rippers it is the spot to be.

Also breaks in summer, when cyclone, east swells hit the reef more flat on. These conditions are not ideal as it makes it more sectony and tends to cause ribs/rebound waves to bounce off the Harbor and ruin the ride.\r\n\r\nThere are two sections to the wave. The ''Pinacle'' (named after the ''Pinnacle'' or ''block'' that sticks out of the water at the end of the reef) on the outside, and the ''inside'' section''. The ''Pinnacle'' is the more serious, hollower section, that is only recommended for experts. There is a deep section 40 meters down from the ''Pinnacle'' where the wave fades before breaking on the inside section. The inside section is less hollow and has more of a bowling wall that offers some rail burring funand rides up to 150 meters.\r\n\r\nIt is a long paddle out, about 400 meters to the ''Pinacle'', takes about 6-minutes of constant paddling. When surfing the ''Pinacle'', it''s better  to paddle out on the inside of the reef where the curvature of the break and slight rip cut''s the paddling time to the takeoff down by about 2-mins. \r\n\r\n Can link up on the right swell and run from the ''Pinnacle'' all the way to the beach, but very rare to find these conditions. \r\n\r\nbreaks from 2ft up to 5ft before it gets too gnarly where the bravest only survive.

Be advised, the wave comes out of about 30 feet deep water onto 2-4 feet of water. There''s plenty rock boils that suck dry, unless the tide is at it''s fullest.

Breaks very hard and fast way out the back on bigger swells, and hopefully you link up with Supers. It''s a heavier wave than Supers.\r\n  \r\n  Supertubes: the main event at J-Bay, sand over rock. Long-walled, fast, perfect, hollow waves, with barrels possible all the way along, but more often towards the end. The wave tends to ''slide'' along the point, dissipating the whitewash for easier duck dives and focusing the energy on the breaking wave. The wall seems to keep coming up at you faster than you expect. The tubes usually need to be ridden high in the pocket. Sets can break wide on bigger days. When it''s really big, the wave has been known to link up all the way to the town beach, through several sections, for a ride of about 1-1.3km+, but on a decent 6 foot+ day the waves are usually about 400m+ long. Tales of 4 or 5 minute rides are exagerated, to get all the way to the end of the long point (which is very rare) is about a 2 minute+ ride, and it needs to be 10 foot+. ''Supers'' is definitely one of the best points in the world.\r\n  \r\n  Salad Bowls and Tubes: there are several sections between the main wave at ''Supertubes'' and ''the Point'' further down, which work during different tides and swells. Tubes is a barrel that works on medium size swells about 600m+ down from the top of Supertubes.\r\n  \r\n  The Point: fat, slow moving wave, that wraps into a little cove at the end of the long point, for about 150m. Holds some size, but doesn''t have the barrels or the class of Supers.\r\n  \r\n  Albatross: inconsistent final section on sand over reef, way down in front of the beach and across from ''the Point''.

Bring water, food, camping gear and anything you need to be autonomous. 1 wood-shack is known to sell meals (but it''s hard to call it a restaurant) and you''ll also find few rugged camping facilities.<br><br>Good on average conditions, excellent on good conditions, Tai Long Wan is a rare, unexpected place for the traveler or businessman in Hong Kong.\r\nIf you do go in South China (i.e Shenzen or GuangZhou), you can consider bringing your board for a short trip to Tai Long Wan, especially if you happen to be there from september to december.\r\nIn any case, you must now consider Hong Kong as a good place to surf !'),

It really only comes alive (like the rest of the Shonan Coast) in the summer and early fall months during the typhoon season.  Basically it neads a sizable swell directly from the South or South Southwest generated by a typhoon or other low pressure system in the Philipine Sea.  Do your homework before you go.  This is too long of a drive to check it on a whim.  If all the other spots on the Shonan Coast are firing or closing out, Sakawa may be worth a look.  It can be packed during smaller days, but when its huge the crowd thins out real quick.  It turns into a real serious wave when it gets overhead, and if your not an experienced surfer stay on the beach.  Its a rivermouth wave so it breaks both left and right. Both are great.  During a typhoon swell the wave is fast, hollow and powerful.  The right breaks just like Off the Wall.  You have time for one bottom turn and then pull in and enjoy the barrel.  If you are goofy foot, pull in and grab a rail right away.  Anything over 8 feet and you may not make all the sections.  The left is just as hollow and almost as quick, but you have more opportunity to make some moves. To the right of the break its deep, so you just have to time the shorepound to make it out.  Last time I was there we could park in the lot right on the beach.  If typhoon passage is to the east (prefered situation)the wind will be a strong offshore out of the north.  This tends to hold up the wave, and make the drop-ins vertical.  The water temp is warm enough during this time of the year that you can get by with trunks or a spring suit.<br><br>This spot can be as fun as Inamuragasaki on the right swell but less crowded than the other spots on the Shonan Coast.  Probably because of its driving distance and the intimidation factor of the wave itself.  During the last typhoon swell I surfed in Japan there was a crowd at all of the usuall ridable breaks on Shonan, so my bro Dave and I took a chance on Sakawa.  We had the spot to ourselves for a while, then we were joined by two profesional Japanese surfers (with photographers in tow) who were way cool to us.  Thats it, not another soul out.  Epic day!  That being said, I have been skunked by the swell gods on a few occaisions going there.<br><br>I love this spot because it is a challenging wave when its big and because of its relative isolation from the madness of the Shonan Coast.  Odawara and the Izu Peninsula are such a cool scene.  I have never been hassled by the locals.  The Japanese people are the most friendly and gracious people on the planet, but the folks in these parts are particulary nice to gaijin.  At least that was my experience.  Just remember that your in their house.  Treat them and their place with respect and you will make friends.  And if the break is not firing, keep heading south along the peninsula and discover one of the many &quot;secret&quot; breaks for yourself.  Kambate!\r\n  \r\n  This spot has become highly localized since the Dane/John John/Yadin photo/video shoot for surfing magazine. It''s also the spot where Yadin injured his ankle.

You might need a 7ft plus board to surf it.\r\nAdvice: Don''t try to take-off on the shoulder, you will probably get pitched on to the reef. The peak may seem bigger but it''s alot safer.\r\nBluff reef or Shipsterns Bluff is now known as Australias most Heaviest, Biggest and Dangerous surf spot. They say Bluff''s when it is doing its thing can match the same power and danger as Pipeline, Hawaii or Teahpoo, Tahiti.\r\nDo not surf it unless you know what your doing or you don''t care if you die. This Spot is the heavest wave in Australia,and offers the biggest barrel anywhere Australia also, there is a far chance that you could die if you blow the take off when it is solid, If you want to surf this wave just ask someone at the Airport in Hobart Only for absolute dare devils. Hook up with locals to take you there, if you''ve got the guts, no-one will stop you heading out.Ship Stern is no hoax. It is a serious wave which breaks best on a HUGE SW swell. The prevailing wind patterns of Tasmania are what can make it and surfing in Tasmania as a whole inconsistent. Many local surfers are terrified that a hord of outsiders will inundate the state and spoil there surfing life. But the fact is not many will return because the Antarctic weather patterns that produce Tassies best swells also produce freezing cold water and a changable climate that will leave most short stay visitors wishing they had gone somewhere else. As for Ship Stern there are a number of local surfers who are far from BIG wave experts who surf this wave, and even those whos surf ability is far from a World Class level. But don''t get me wrong this is a SERIOUS wave it may NOT be Australias biggest nor HEAVIEST wave but as surf photographer Sean Davey said during the 2001 easter sessions. It is the most dangerous place to surf he had seen. I personaly feel it is only a matter of time before some surf cowboy finds the life smashed out of them on the very close truck sized boulders in front of the wave face. As yet NO ONE has surfed this wave when it is huge. And even the local LEGENDS were far away when the largest SW swell in a long time created 25 foot plus perfect conditions. And I have hardcopy photos of an empty line up to prove that one. All I have to say to the Tassie localism is grow-up ... I think you should show some respect for those outsiders who are willing to surf this place. Most of you, even the hardcore had never even set eyes on the place before it was all exposed in 2001.<br><br>Bushwalk in, its a beautiful place. Even if you don''t have a death wish, its something you have to see. awesome, surrounded by huge cliffs, large bolders and very deep water 1.5 hr walk from car park or 30 min boat trip.

Best swell is a southwest north west combo for wedge tube fun. Generally the beach has about 4-5 main banks that always are in the same general area.<br><br>Nice, relaxing. Hardly ever crowded. Annoying motorbike riders ruin the tranquilty of the spot. Good spot for Hamiltons weekend surfers to give their Subaru legacies and Mitsubishi Libreos a run. Odd fisherman in the summer,but mostly they leap to their deaths off the rocks at the northern end of the beach and are not a hassle. Good place for wave starved east cost surfers to come and get some real waves.'),

I wouldn''t make a special trip to go to Golden Beach but if your planning a holiday to Thassos, perhaps take your board....just in case!<br><br>years ago, way back in the 80s, I worked on an oil rig situated between Kavalla and Thassos, and on a couple of occasions saw clean lined up groundswell passing the rig and heading towards the island.\r\n\r\nThis was in Nov after stormy weather, but I would think Thassos has surf pretty regularly through the winter...'),

Somelocals  can show some ''surfers'' attitude but usualy nobody cares.\r\nIn summer however beach can be extremy crowded with bathing guests and swimmers.<br><br>Although usually not fantastic its often very surfable (check the webcam).

The place, Likin, it''s amazing, water chanels like Venice, tidy streets, friendly locals and no crime!  it''s an amazing place. The only one like this that i''ve seen in Guatemala. it is a sand bottom right-hander that breaks just in front of a jetty built in the mouth of a river that flows for a good distance parallel to the beach until it comes out to sea by the jetty. Even with the right conditions (see below), it is surfable roughly 2 to 4 hours (at best) a day, as the spot is very, very tide oriented. It needs a low-incoming tide with no-wind or very little wind conditions (e.g. 6 to 9 or 10am). At incoming mid-tide a rip makes it very difficult to stay on the point and thus the possibilities of actually riding a wave are greatly restrained. At high-tide the rip slows down and it becomes surfable again (wind permitting), but only if there is a big swell. The outgoing tide creates a very strong rip and the wave is literally un-surfable for 6 straight hours.It is a good wave but not a 5 star wave. It is also not an all surfers wave. It is a very powerful wave, fast and hollow that breaks in shallow water and requires a very fast stand-up and turns that you can only achieve if you are an advanced or expert surfer. The ride is pretty much of 30-50 meters of a speeding wall forming in front of you and when the critical section is passed there is actually not much to rip, because the wave fades out. Beware of left-handers, since they close out frequently and the whitewaters take you straight into the rocks of the jetty. Still, with the right conditions, the spot can be a lot of fun if you are a good surfer who is not afraid of nasty wipe-outs. About the area: the spot is very close to an electric plant with high chimneys puffing black smoke on the side of big warehouses used by the harbor of San Jose. It is not a pretty sight. The rest of the beach, for miles and miles, including the beach break of San Jose (a small and dirty port-town), Itzapa and another spot further west that I checked is simply a powerful close out with the (very) occasional wave that shows a shoulder to rip on.

I went in July and the water was bathwater warm, the sea was deep blue, the water was clean, the beach was pure white, there were only a handful of surfers sharing more than enough waves.  AND THE WAVES were unbelievable.  5+ feet, consistent, powerful.  The bottom was a little scary during low tide.  I can barely surf and I was catching huge waves by accident (honestly caught one while paddling OUT).  And the rides are LONG, all the way into the shore from way, way out.  Later in the day conditions pick up and the waves get bigger (6-8ft), coming in sets of 3-5, making it really hard to paddle out, so I sat on the beach while my boyfriend and his buddy got pummeled.  I know this sounds like a stupid chick review because I really don''t know that much about surfing, but I do know that Costa Azul is a great place, and even if I''m wrong about surfing, where else can you buy beer for 50 cents and drink it while you are driving down the most amazing stretch of coastline?&quot;'),

It breaks on heavy north/northwest swells. It is also the most sheltered spot (along with gas chambers) from consistently stiff northeast winds that ruin all waves on all north facing beaches. So if the swell is getting in there the wave will be great since the wind will be offshore and not much chop in the water.\r\n\r\nIt is close to wishing well but i think its better since its more sheletered from the wind.\r\n\r\nIf wishing well its breaking then manglito is too. Wilderness has to be about 6-10ft+ for it to break. The larger the better since it breaks somewhat close to shore and when its small its just too close to the rocky coastline.\r\n\r\nGas Chambers is ussually smaller. So if you check out Gas Chambers and its small and inconsistent then chances are there will be a wave at manglito.\r\n\r\nIts a very photogenic wave since its close to shore and has such good form. Coming out of the bushes on the coastline you get a glimpse of perfection that really pumps you up. The best waves start breaking close to the point and barrel perfectly all accross right infront of the parking area. Some sets will square up on the sand/reef and be too fast with tubes hard to make so pick waves carefully. If the swell has a lot of west in it a small left can pop up from time to time but its almost all rights. And when its big, right is the only option. The spot looks like it can hold very very large waves. I have never seen it close out really.\r\n\r\nWhen its good there will be usually about 10-15 people in the water including some pros. If Gas chambers is breaking most people will be there or at wishing well. Its a heavy wave but very clean.'),

But tis rare.\r\n\r\nOn a good day, the waves can get to upto 6-8ft. The wind will normally tell u if there are waves. If there is wind, there will probably be waves. Also the longer the wind has been blowing (ie a week) the bigger the waves.<br><br>If ur a begginner, Dubai is a great place to start. Waves will rarely be big enough to scare the shit out of u and they are easy to catch. The bigger waves can be a challenge to catch, so u can keep practicing on those good days.\r\n\r\nI ain''t much of surfer myself. I normally stick to bodyboarding (much easier and cheaper) and sometimes I go windsurfin when there are no waves. Bodyboardin is pretty wicked in DXB in the winter and it''s an alternative to surfin. Also the waves don''t have to be as big for body boardin.\r\n\r\nMost surfers here can''t wait until the winter coz that''s when the waves start comin in.

The surf shops here are few and don''t really stock alot of surf products, coz there ain''t much demand. However the surf scene here has improved alot as young teens like myself have taken to the beaches as there is all year sunshine.\r\n\r\nDubai''s the type of place where ppl with similar interests get to know each other quickly. There aren''t that many spots to surf so we stick the few good ones. The mega problem is that the waves are too small for seriuos surfers. 10ft was probably the biggest the waves have ever got and experienced surfers start to get tired of tryin to surf minis. Dubai is better for bodyboarders.\r\n\r\nthe great thing here is the weather. Ur almost guarented sunshine all year and ur bound to get a suntan. Also the sea life here ain''t too dangerous.

There is a hard core surf shop on main street called Horizons West Surf Shop ( the oldest hardcore surf shop in Santa Monica... est. 1977) There is of course the Santa Monica pier for amusement and stuffs, the 3rd st. promenade for the little shops (recently opened a rip curl surf shop) and the street performers. If you go a little south there is the famous venice beach, why the hell did they destroy the pavillion ??!! And also, since Santa Monica-Venice Beach is actually dogtown, don''t be surprised to find lots of  dogtown stickers on signs or in the local surf shops some surfboards with a pacific ocean park pier design on it, you can see in this area that the 60''-70''s surf scene is still present ( well that''s my opinion).<br><br>It is a very cool surf spot. The vibes in the water are really nice... peace &amp; love pretty much.\r\nBut here is the bad part of it, the pollution, lots of bacterias in the water so if you have some pizzas on your body, don''t surf there unless you want to get infected (don''t do like me!)

There are a few surfing instructors that are normally available by there and they charge about $50.00 or so to help out the beginners.  On occasion, you might meet a hottie that''s going to ask for surfing tips. it''s pretty cool.  There are a lot of inner city programs that use this spot to teach inner city kids to surf.  It''s pretty cool, and you need to watch for them -- try not to run them over.  Overall, the locals are great and very friendly.  You may get a couple of Haole''s, (by the way I''m from the South pacific), that get to this spot on a shortboard and act like they own the ocean, but they are often overwhelmed by the local crowd. Just be cool, and give a wave -- take a wave.<br><br>It''s a nice spot if your bringing your girlfriend or wife with you, or your kids.  It''s friendly, and I only go to this spot because there are always waves here.  They aren''t the best, but at least you can surf them.  You won''t get sponsored surfing here, but you''ll have fun.'),

IB can be good during a variety of swell size (and directions), from small to huge. Up to head-high, conditions on both sides near the pier can be good, and you can usually find several peaks along the beach running south of the pier. There is also a good break in front of the "dinosaur cage." The clever among you can figure that one out on your own. IB can get crowded on good days (especially the weekend). I think the best spot is in front of the last house on the beach before you get to the estuary. The locals do regulate there, but I never had a problem with them. Just be respectful and dont bring a crowd. When it gets huge Sloughs really wakes up. If you can make it through the shore pound, there is an offshore sandbar directly in front of the mouth of the estuary. It doesn''t really fire until it gets overhead during the winter swells. Personally, I think comparing it to Mavericks in size-potential MIGHT be overstating it a bit but I have never seen it close out. The bigger it gets, the further out it breaks. I have been out there in double-overhead conditions several times, and I would either be alone or with only a few other guys out. The right is fun, but its the left that goes off. You can get rides that are several hundred yards long - NO JOKE! Word to the wise though; this place is not for the faint of heart. Its kinda spooky being out there by yourself, a quarter of a mile offshore with a shifty peak and strong side-shore current, with the occaisional shark sighting.\r\n\r\nIt is very polluted from the Tiajuana River and the sharks come in to eat the garbage out of the river. It is not uncommon to have sting rays which are infecyed with diseases and to see logs, washing machines, ect floating by when you are surfing.

Lotsa backwash here but not to where it messes up the wave totally.  It always seems to happen right when the wave is about to break so be ready for it.  The left peak breaks over a hideous coral shelf with coral heads visisble one foot underwater.  It can often be a lengthy ride but a barrel and a few hits on the lip and a launch ramp at the end are the norm.  When the surf is big it creates a sandbar on the inside producing a powerful end section barrel or launch pad.  The right is a whole different story.  It tends to pinch but on its day, Yoks'' right can be the barrel of a lifetime over a shallow reef bottom with a whole lot of caves.  It''s frustratingly fast as it starts to peel over the reef but the take off is easy.  Do not eat it.  You WILL hit your head.<br><br>If you want to feel like your in some place desolate on Oahu, go to Yokahama.  Absolutely beautiful setting.  This is where you can get the real deal of Oahu, Hawaii.  Nice tradewind breezes, perfect water, hot and sunny, picturesque mountains, and a Hawaiian feel; it''s the place to be on those sunny Hawaiian days.  Many locals like to camp out on the weekends making the bay pretty occupied.  Go there on Tuesday through Thursday and you''ll find two camping tents and only the lifeguards surfing the waves all by themselves.  Definitely worth the drive.<br><br>One of my all-time favorite spots.  It can produce some pretty scary rides.  The barrels get pretty hefty.  The launch sections are perfect for bodyboarding and surfing.  Lotsa speed.  It''s hard to tell when the sets will come in because the swells come in from 300-500 foot deep water giving the wave a defecation load of power.  The swells jack up and roll in with no mercy.  If you''re not paying attention you could get the worst beating of your life.  Pipeline can give you a beating, but Yoks can roll you over the reef all the way to sand.  I almost died out there.  I''ve bashed my head and blacked out for a couple seconds and got three six foot bombs on the head.  The place can be a nightmare.  But it also can be the funnest wave to ride.  Take a video camera.  When the south shore has a swell, Yoks catches it a foot or two bigger.  It is only worth checking when the surf report says the south shore is three feet or bigger.  When there''s a northwest swell of four feet, Yoks can take in the swell at six feet.  It''s a great place to get away from the crowds when swells hit, but I''ve seen Yoks crowded as hell.  One irritating thing about this spot is the wind.  At times it will blow offshore all day from sunrise to sunset.  On the majority of days the wind will blow offshore for 30 minutes, then change onshore for 10 minutes, then switch back to offshore.  The wind does this in weird increments and intervals.  The locals are cool down here for some reason but that doesn''t mean you can be a dick.  Remember, you''re still on the West Side.'),

The best tide and direction varies throughout the year.  It goes through phases, yet also seems random.  I have had many days when a reliable source said &quot;no waves&quot; but during a twenty minute period later that day I was catching chest high barrels off the jetty.  If you plan to visit, just go and enjoy the scene, and then, if you happen to be there on a good day, look at it as gravy.\r\nMore specifically, a lot of times you need to line up real tight with the jetty, at the very tip, and to the south.  It can get hairy, especially when there are a hundred little kids sitting inside.\r\nCape May has two small but good surf shops.  South End is on the beach, about a ten-minute walk from the Cove, and Summer Sun is on the pedestrian mall in the center of town, about a fifteen minute walk.<br><br>The Cove, as a beach, is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.  From the last jetty in Cape May, where the cove begins, it is about a 30 minute brisk walk to the lighthouse, and the entire stretch of beach (except for about 300 yards from the jetty) is a protected wildlife santuary.  The general atmosphere is very pleasant.  The locals are relatively cool, with the edge you''d expect on the few days of the year when its head high and really going off.  Especially in the last two years, a lot of parents have been sending their kids off into the water with brand new boards and no lessons.  Sometimes it is downright dangerous.  Once I actually saw a kid drop in on a guy, and after a scary collision, his Mom, from her lounge chair, laughed and said, &quot;Oh, did you see Bobby wipe out?&quot; to her equally clueless husband.  You can easily expect a couple hundred kids in the water during July and August.  However, the kids go back to school just in time for the hurricane season, and the best time to surf anywhere in New Jersey is the fall.  Nice weather weekends can still draw a large crowd through October.<br><br>The Cove is mostly about long boarding.  I ride a 9''6&quot; 75% of the time, and a 7'' when its chest high and up.  Of course, the kids will only ride short boards, which is why they end up bobbing around on the inside getting in the way.  It''s where I learned to surf a few years ago, so that always helps me keep the kid thing in perspective.  A friend from a town up the road once referred to the Cove as Waikiki.  He must have meant the long, knee high waves.  (The town where he surfs has a lot of hotels with fake palm trees, so maybe his is just jealous of Cape May''s natural beauty.)

Most of teh time it breaks in the middle of the wall.\r\n  The Paddle Out:\r\n  When you get on the beach make sure to watch teh wvae first and time the sets so you can have an easy paddle out, but if your thee on a storm swell, dont waist your time watching cause it will just be a minefield of whitewash and it will be a tricky paddle out, but on the semi.- clean days you can time the sets.\r\n   If its big and its low tide, when you reach the sandbar you will be duckdiving in about 1- 2ft. of water with 6 - to bigger waves breaking right ontop of that and its just a pain, the whitewash will drag you everywhere. On High tide its a pretty easy paddle out but its still tricky. \r\n  The sandbar:\r\n  After the hurrican season it will change, and it will change the waves from super hollow wedges to super hollow walls of water and just about everything in between. On somedays though at low tide it will send out some pretty insane backwash so thats always a hazard.\r\n  The Wave:\r\n  it is a very powerful one, it will throw you onto the sandbar and bash you.

Another bad factor of Surf Bay is that it reeks of rotting kelp, which can is pretty rancid and smells quite like like sewage, but its not.

There are like these beach huts where you can get most of the locals culinary to eat and you can have anything to drink (for those how like some booze after the surf). The food is great and people also. The surf can get crowed on weekends but in the summer it''s really bad at this spot. How ever there are many good spots around to choose from and most are actually reef brakes. There is no Place Like Salvador Bahia.<br><br>The beach got really famous for it''s surf in the 80s for holding some big national contests. The wave works both ways and can get pretty good. I would say it''s high light is it''s barrows on the lowing tides. It has a shallow sand bar that can make the wave pitch nicely. The weakness is the wind. There are normally constant onshore what make the surf normally not  as good as it gets. I''ve seen it brake big. It can work at up to 8'' on the right swell. But the biggest it gets, the further you paddle.'),

Entry in and out of the water is dead easy even when its big, but the outside section suits experts and intermediates only, the inside section can be ridden even by beginners. Outside it breaks very close to rocks you definitely need to be aware of, starting on the furthest rock outcrop on big set days (about 8-10 feet). The takeoff here is intense, and sometimes impossible, jacking and pitching with backwash and sidewash, with crunching, thundering lips. You can take off an a routine 6 footer on the outside only to find yourself going backwards up the wave now an 8 footer, then embedded in the lip over the falls. The kind of place you can do nothing wrong and still get crunched. Locals talk about the &quot;catapault&quot;, a lip which throws you way out in front of the wave if you are unlucky enough to get a sidewash combine with a big takeoff. There are several rocks in this zone, especially toward the last rock outcrop: Ive seen tourists turn up and miss it by a few feet, not even knowing it was there. Even the locals take this section seriously. You can be rewarded with a great powerful crunching wall for about 100-150m on the outside, before you get to the last rock outcrop. Size outside is from 4 to 10 feet. Then there is the inside section, which is usually mellow and can be ridden by beginners, holds from about 2 to 7 feet. You takeoff at the last rock outcrop and can ride for a further 200m, or so. Definitely best at low tide, and when there is more sand in the bay, holds southwest wind but south wind is a touch choppy.

Thankfully it remains off the high-profile surfing circuits thanks to its difficult access and the cultural barriers that foreign travelers often experience when visiting Peru unaccompanied.  \r\n  \r\n  The wave begins far from the town, some 2 kilometers out to the cape.  The wave breaks along the cape and tends to hit its first reforming section at the point.  The point is a large rock outcropping, where the wave tends to close-out as it arrives from the cape, but experienced surfers can often make the long barelling section in front of the point and begin the longest ride of their lives towards the pier.  Taking off from the point, the ride takes you flying past the sand dunes and the hotels, arriving at the section known as El Hombre, which peels right in front of the infamous El Hombre motel/hostal.  When the section from the point connects with the El Hombre section, you can ride the wave all the way into the town, right up to the pier!  Most people don''t have the legs to keep up with this fast rifeling wave for that entire distance.<br><br>Chicama is one of the best waves in the world and visitors should be respectful towards the locals and the environment.  We are serious about protecting the town''s greatest natural resource and visiting surfers are always welcome when they arrive with good vibes and friendly, respectul intentions.  Chicama has been populated by native peruvians for more than 6,000 years and it is the ancestors of the local people that first started surfing on reed surf-craft thousands of years ago!  Among the best local surfers are Juan Arroyo, aka Pajarete, a good friend that owns one of the hotels in front of El Hombre.  El Zorro is also a greatly respected surfer that was one of the first local chargers and a great photographer.<br><br>You can choose to stay at the luxurious Chicama Surf Resort or you can stay at any of the cheaper hotels along the beach front.  The Chicama Surf Resort has the benefit of the tow boat that only upsets those that are snaked by it.  Personally, I like to paddle and walk, but blaming your lack of courtesy on the tow boat is justified since there are more than plenty of waves for everyone and the tow boat is a problem for everyone, while it is a lifeline for the unexperienced (kooks) and older surfers.  Remember: someday you too might be unfit and  want to throw money away to keep up with the good surfers , though unable to paddle such an amazing distance.  Walking is for those that want to be blessed by the gods of Chicama, those brave souls willing to sacrifice like the legendary surfers that pioneered the place.  Walking and paddling is also for the budget travelers that can''t afford or refuse the laziness of the boat.  Your best bet is to visit Chicama with Machapu Adventures, since we are the locals and we will make sure you have a great experience either walking or by boat.

On superlow it turns into a mutant slab which gets dangerous. Breaks predominantly right but left too over a shallow volcanic rock reef. (Which hurts when you hit it.) <br><br>Takes a pretty long paddle to get there and local fisherman have reported seeing many huge great whites in the area, so be careful and get out''ve there if you start getting a bad vibe.

Maderas picks up both south and north swells and will hold up to double-overhead waves. Most days, it’s a playful wave, fast and racy with occasional barrel sections. Chances are you won’t fear for your life surfing here. The best tide is usually, mid-incoming, but high tide down to mid-outgoing also breaks well at times. It is rarely good at dead low. There are two main peaks at Maderas. The primary peak is a peeling right hander that breaks in the middle of the beach, in front of the north end of the parking area. The very next peak to the south comes the opposite direction and is usually a bit shorter and faster, but still a peeling left hander. At the very south end of the beach, in front of the rocks, there is another left peak that breaks on bigger swells. Most of the time it is a short and mushy wave but at times, has a barrel section. There are also more peaks to the North, but they are usually not quite as good as the main peaks and thus, not surfed as often -not a bad place to go if you want to avoid the crowd or if you are learning how to surf.\r\n  \r\n  Maderas is arguably Nicaragua’s most crowded surf break (Popoyo is a close second). While it is still easy to get waves here, it is unlikely you will be surfing alone. On it’s most crowded day, expect to find approx. 30+ people in the water although more often, there will be less than 20. Since Maderas is usually a broad mix of beginners just learning to surf, locals and traveling surfers who are staying in San Juan Del Sur, the vibe is typically mello. Come to Maderas to get wet and have fun, not to fight for waves. As with most places in Nicaragua, you can beat the main crowds by surfing early in the morning or late in the afternoon.<br><br>well, this is one of the best surf spots in Nicaragua. pretty cool by the waves, people and enviroment. near of the city, easy to access,friendly local surfers! its fine!<br><br>if u are coming to Nicaragua, visit this surf spot! u will enjoy it!

Some of the most beautiful girls in Japan are here in summer! (no joke)\r\n  \r\n  Super cool locals who are friendly and enthusiastic to foreigners.  '),

PATOLES is a powerful left hand point break. Very long and fun, and the best surf is between March and October. DIMAS is a fun Beach Break with both rights and lefts. Usually gets swells best from the south west. Hollow, powerfull and barreling when its on. LA PUNTITA is a left hand point break with a sand/rock bottom. Very fun and sometimes long waves. Good for all levels of surfing ability. RUCOS is a Beachbreak with rights and lefts and is very powerful, fast and hollow. Starts working at 3-5 ft and holds up to 10 ft. One of Sinaloa''s best beach breaks. <br><br>I stayed in this little fishing village called Las Barras de Piaxtla, from there you can access all the spots. If you are a group of at least 4 people you can hire a boat to take you to Patoles, which is a lot easier then taking a car. The other spots are pretty easy to reach with a car. Las Barras de Piaxtla is the last secret for surfers. There is nobody around, you will have the wave to yourself.<br><br>It is pretty remote, so if you want to party hard with crowds this place is not for you. On the other hand if you want to go and just hang out with a group of friends or your girl, this place is perfect. There is also Sea Kayak, Fishing, Biking and Bird watching in the estuary.'),

Its a solid right, very long ride when its big. \r\n    Theres another break waay out to the right, but its  a long paddle but well worth it.

They can get really big, very fast and glassy, but arent as strong as they look.

Watch for rocks on the way in, and head out to the right, in the direction of the houses, to get around whitewash and to either the inside or outside breaks.<br><br>When this spot is cranking, the far outside can be amazing, and is never crowded. A good northeast or east swell can make for some really clean and fun 5-7+ waves. These waves break from open ocean to reef, and can be really powerful. Less adventurous folks can stay in the inside breaks, where it peaks at about 5 on a good day during the winter, and is usually about 3-4 feet hawaiian scale.\r\n  However, the outside is almost never consistent and is often just whitewater mess that is really difficult to get past, or worth it at all.\r\n  \r\n  The inside break is divided into two halves. The first is closer to the beach, and is positioned right in front of the gate to the valley. Shortboarders and body surfers usually hang here, because the waves pop up and break faster. It gets shallow at low tide, but this area is sandy, so it isn''t too bad.\r\n  \r\n  The second is positioned in front of the bunker nearest to the valley. This is more popular with the longboarding crowd. The waves are not as frequent, but are often bigger and cleaner, and also go farther.\r\n  \r\n  On a good day, a swell will overlap each spot, since they are diagonal to each other. Each spot can go right or left. For the second break, left leads to a sometimes shallow reef (but longer ride,) and right can overlap the shortboarders, if there are any there.\r\n  The first, more inside break tends to peel right, but can lead to an annoying area of strong current if you ride it too far.\r\n  <br><br>As a person who lives, literally, down the street from this break, I can say that even though it isn''t exactly world class, it''s always fun to throw a board in the water here. Plus, there are many days where you and another person are the only people there, with the surf all to yourself. Beats driving to town or up north and fighting crowds.\r\n  I''ve never had a problem with people or aggressiveness at this spot. \r\n  \r\n  When there''s a strong trade swell, sometimes bluebottles/man of wars float in and hug the shore. Bring some vinegar and meat tenderizer in your car in case you get stung. As for sharks, typical common sense applies: don''t go out at dawn, dusk, or when the water is murky.

When I was there last year I was able to watch master carver Stephen Umari carve a short board with integral twin fins from a raw hand-hewn plank in just a few hours with only an ase, a chisel, and a pocket knife. \r\n  With some advance notice (via Charlie) I think Mr. Umari could easily be persuaded to custom-carve a board for a visitor. A vistor with enough time could even help cut the tree for it.\r\n  \r\n  I''m biased, but I think I can say without fear that Kragur people are incredibly hospitable. there are no commercial accomodationsin Kragur, but Charlie can arrange food and lodging with a local family for a very modest price. It''s hot there, as in most of coastal PNG, but it cools off at night for good sleeping and there are very,very few mosquitoes. I sleep without a net, which may be a little daring, but I always wake up without any bites. The village gets its water from a rushing moutain stream that I''ve been drinking from for decades without mishap. There are also great places to bathe in the stream,some of them beneath small waterfalls.\r\n  \r\n  if you want soemthing a little more polished than a family stay, there is a well-run local guest house in Shagur Village, just down the path from Kragur. It''s called the Polen Guest House and here is its address:\r\n  \r\n  Wolfy Kalem\r\n  c/o Polen Guest House\r\n  PO Box 817\r\n  Wewak, ESP\r\n  Papua New Guinea\r\n  \r\n  Wewak, the jumping of place for Kairiru, can be a little gritty and it ain''t romantic. But once you''re on your way to Kairiru it''s a whole different world. \r\n    \r\n  <br><br>If I were still surfing, I''d pack my bags and get out there every December and January.'),

When there are big swells it''s possible to see the Tres Marias from the shore, so you can imagine how big they are (clear image from 5km away)... few locals have dropped the Tres Marias. \r\n  \r\n  The city of Rio Grande has one of the biggest ports in South America and is very close to the conection between Lagoa dos Patos (one of the largest lagoons in the world) and the Atlantic Ocean. The two fin lines that show up in the map location are called "Molhes" in portuguese... some couple hundred meters away from the left one (Molhe Oeste) is where the magic happens! This stone barrier has a little wind-cart (a mine cart with a sail) and you can take it to go to the end tip of the Molhe, that is more than  4km long. Along the way it is possible to see sea lions and wolves hanging out in the rocks (those guys really know the best spots!) and sometimes dolphins.\r\n  \r\n  The waves are so powerful that they can drag the big rocks and concrete blocks from the stone barrier. There are registers that blocks with 20 tons where wiped out! The guys that work in the port and cargo ships call it "Hawaii" and it is important to remeber that this is a very dangerous wave and can produce some giant series after series killers that will push you back to shore like a tsunami! So you must always have extra caution and rescue boats around.<br><br>Unknown huge wave (slap, powerful and fast) is the biggest one in Brazil alongside Laje da Jaguaruna and Ilha dos Lobos.

I don''t see why it hasn''t taken off. It has arguably the best beach on the Pacific side of México – 80 km of wide, flat, powder sand. Pick your own peak. The five resident surfers see so few others they are happy to see you and may even show you a “secret spot” or two that isn''t a beachbreak. Wintertime when I''m there isn''t the best but there will be waves. They can be a little mushy but I still got the fastest section of my life and also the longest ride. The key is taking off right under the peak. From the shore you see the lip throwing and you think, “Cool, I might even get a little “tubito” but when you get out there you see more of a ramp than a wall. Mo'' bettah in the summer when it gets bigger and wallier. Figure 1st of May to 1st of November as the best time. If you go to YouTube and search “rucosponger” you will see some HD videos I took of Paúl Castillo which show a so-so winter day. It also shows one of the “features” of having such a gently-sloping beach and bottom. You have 4 or 5 lines of breaking waves to duck your way through to get outside. Paddle-out will be 200-300 yards depending on swell. The break works on any tide but is best early in the morning when there is offshore or little wind. There is often a strong current set to the south. Again, my notes are for the winter. The basic swell direction in this part of México in winter is from the NW. Summer brings longer period swell from the SSW which is what both Mazatlán [where I live in the winter] and this area needs.\r\n  \r\n  To get there: Playa Novillero is in the north of Nayarít, just south of the border with Sinaloa. Go to Acaponeta, then head makai.\r\n  \r\n  To stay: My favorite place is the Hotel y Restaurant Miramar. Brenda and Omar will treat you like family. Camping is available.\r\n  \r\n  To eat: Nothing wrong with the above but I like to spread the wealth around and eat at the neighboring Beto''s Restaurant which is run by Paúl''s family. He also has a variety of surfboards and other wave tools for rent.\r\n  \r\n  If you can talk Spanish it will help a lot. They don''t get a lot of gringo tourists.

Bring your down the line board on most days, the main attraction is a fast, shallow barrel on the inside section, be prepared for it.<br><br>There are at least 5-6 different peaks you can surf on various types of swells:\r\n  Winter:  This is your time to get Sidewalks at it''s best.  I saw it break most perfectly the late afternoon before the December 4th, 2007 NW swell, very long period, very consistent, this makes for better 2nd and 3rd+ waves as more water will be sucked off the reef.  Generally more inconsistent than other breaks on the Westside, but also the most hollow wave you will find on most days.  Marine Labs will also be good on early season swells while the sand is still there.  If you dare, paddle north on low tide midsize west swells to find a secret surprise.\r\n  Summer:  This is when you will find a much larger diversity of waves all over the Natural Bridges reef.  Starting at the very north, directly in front of the Marine Labs point is a slab wave that breaks over a big flat rock that sticks up at low tide(surf it high tide), really not a great wave compared to the others.  Marine Labs is a local summer spot that actually regularly houses a lot of out of towners.  You can surf this spot at low or high tide, but generally 2-3 ft is best for surfing the main peak at 3-5 ft.  The outside peak gets very serious at size, and is usually a closeout.  There is also a left on the other side of the channel that runs right into shallow rocks, works on any swell but only on wide sets.  Sidewalks will only break on summer swells over 4ft on the buoy, and it''s generally less makeable with all the sand it has on it during summertime.  Finally, there is a left that breaks off the iconic natural bridge off the beach.  Generally very mushy, it occasionally offers a nice 50 yard wall to ride into a closeout.'),

Drive south direction Salinas and have a look on the swell and periode forecast for Cruz Roja at sandy beach near the light tower of Jandia/ Moro el Jable. Very often there are only rather beginner conditions with nearly flat water. But if your are lucky, you can have a very yummy surf with perfect sets of more than overshoulder-waves coming from south-east for hours, twice a day. This beachy spot will only run a few times per season, but then it can be amazing.\r\n  \r\n  You surely won´t be alone in the water this time, because all the foreign and local pro guys from the whole island will be with you. The waves are very powerful and there is also a possibility of undertows in the curve. Ask the life guard, while he keeps tourists out of the water, when they try to ignore the red flag to swim in the surfzone, which is a dangerous idea at this point. If it brings you too close to the beach, take the easy (right) way around the sets over the sandbank to come in again.\r\n  \r\n  If you`re a beginner or intermediate (like me): Relax! Stay on the beach on this day, take some photos and learn from watching the big boys (you won`t be alone). Come again the next morning. There is also a good chance for some good days before and after the high-wave day with quite nice small and medium wave sets at different tides.\r\n  \r\n  And there are also days with good windswell conditions (when coming from north-east for some days) for fun beach waves over the harmless sandy ground. In this case the spot moves 100 m south towards the light tower. If you`re very early in the water, you might have them all on your own. But the whole spot situation runs mostly not constantly and it can happen, that you`re alone on the beach at sunrise, but without surfable waves. It also depends on the sandbank, which will change it`s shape while the windy weeks. A general problem can be a strong off-shore wind. At least there is a chance to meet a few crazy locals / boogy-boarders too, but it depends on your surf skill to find your way.<br><br>This spot can be huge, mostly it`s nearly flat and you can watch the surf schools only, while thinking why do you waste your time on the beach.\r\n  \r\n  If you`re in Jandia and had no luck because of bad surf conditions (which is the normal situation) and you are not willing to drive the dirt road to Salinas at this day or the long way to the northshore, then you can also go sailing, windsurfing or diving at the Robinson Hotel. Jandia is a very touristic place like some other villages on Fuerte, but visit Moro el Jable, the old part of the town, which is more lovely with excellent fish restaurants and bars in the centre.\r\n  \r\n  Beneath some very cool medium groundswell sets I also had proper windswell-sessions with double-rainbows and countless waves around 1 m for 2x3 hours per day till sunset on 6 days in one week.
