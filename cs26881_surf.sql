You need good local knowledge.\r\n  \r\n  Heavy take off which then rifles off down the line like a runnaway freight train, make sure you got a few surfs under your belt before surfing here once it hits the 4ft + mark otherwise you could get hurt. I also seriously advise taking a first aid kit on board with you as it breaks over shallow reef and reef gashes are not uncommon. <br><br>when it breaks its good...when that is...trying to get right wind right tide and swell..hmmmm don''t let anybody bullshit you you gotta have luck..one other kak surfspot near by jellybabies..names says it all  soft and mushy\r\n  \r\n  I disagree, you don''t need luck you need knowledge and a good logistic .. I see crew heading out there when I''m heading for the hills .. they don''t know what they''re doing and thats why they miss out. Like I said earlier it''s all about winds, tides, and swell direction, once you got it wired it''s like reading a book! Anyway if anyone wants any advice feel free to give me a yell, I live here! ... lamoucate'),

In small surf it is normally very busy, you need to show the same respect as you would at your home break - There are locals, some with bad attitudes, but if you hold back you will not get any waves. There can be a hundred people in the water on an offshore 4 foot day, in which case you have to hassle a bit. When it is 6 foot and over the &quot;Bad Boy&quot; locals stay on the pier. You must ride a gun on low tide as it gets very hollow and fast with some waves offering more than one barrel, on high tide you can still ride a short board on the medium big days and will be able to do big carves!

I do not surf here anymore as I am in my mid 40''s and have mellowed out, but for young rippers it is the spot to be.

Also breaks in summer, when cyclone, east swells hit the reef more flat on. These conditions are not ideal as it makes it more sectony and tends to cause ribs/rebound waves to bounce off the Harbor and ruin the ride.\r\n\r\nThere are two sections to the wave. The ''Pinacle'' (named after the ''Pinnacle'' or ''block'' that sticks out of the water at the end of the reef) on the outside, and the ''inside'' section''. The ''Pinnacle'' is the more serious, hollower section, that is only recommended for experts. There is a deep section 40 meters down from the ''Pinnacle'' where the wave fades before breaking on the inside section. The inside section is less hollow and has more of a bowling wall that offers some rail burring funand rides up to 150 meters.\r\n\r\nIt is a long paddle out, about 400 meters to the ''Pinacle'', takes about 6-minutes of constant paddling. When surfing the ''Pinacle'', it''s better  to paddle out on the inside of the reef where the curvature of the break and slight rip cut''s the paddling time to the takeoff down by about 2-mins. \r\n\r\n Can link up on the right swell and run from the ''Pinnacle'' all the way to the beach, but very rare to find these conditions. \r\n\r\nbreaks from 2ft up to 5ft before it gets too gnarly where the bravest only survive.

Be advised, the wave comes out of about 30 feet deep water onto 2-4 feet of water. There''s plenty rock boils that suck dry, unless the tide is at it''s fullest.

Breaks very hard and fast way out the back on bigger swells, and hopefully you link up with Supers. It''s a heavier wave than Supers.\r\n  \r\n  Supertubes: the main event at J-Bay, sand over rock. Long-walled, fast, perfect, hollow waves, with barrels possible all the way along, but more often towards the end. The wave tends to ''slide'' along the point, dissipating the whitewash for easier duck dives and focusing the energy on the breaking wave. The wall seems to keep coming up at you faster than you expect. The tubes usually need to be ridden high in the pocket. Sets can break wide on bigger days. When it''s really big, the wave has been known to link up all the way to the town beach, through several sections, for a ride of about 1-1.3km+, but on a decent 6 foot+ day the waves are usually about 400m+ long. Tales of 4 or 5 minute rides are exagerated, to get all the way to the end of the long point (which is very rare) is about a 2 minute+ ride, and it needs to be 10 foot+. ''Supers'' is definitely one of the best points in the world.\r\n  \r\n  Salad Bowls and Tubes: there are several sections between the main wave at ''Supertubes'' and ''the Point'' further down, which work during different tides and swells. Tubes is a barrel that works on medium size swells about 600m+ down from the top of Supertubes.\r\n  \r\n  The Point: fat, slow moving wave, that wraps into a little cove at the end of the long point, for about 150m. Holds some size, but doesn''t have the barrels or the class of Supers.\r\n  \r\n  Albatross: inconsistent final section on sand over reef, way down in front of the beach and across from ''the Point''.

Bring water, food, camping gear and anything you need to be autonomous. 1 wood-shack is known to sell meals (but it''s hard to call it a restaurant) and you''ll also find few rugged camping facilities.<br><br>Good on average conditions, excellent on good conditions, Tai Long Wan is a rare, unexpected place for the traveler or businessman in Hong Kong.\r\nIf you do go in South China (i.e Shenzen or GuangZhou), you can consider bringing your board for a short trip to Tai Long Wan, especially if you happen to be there from september to december.\r\nIn any case, you must now consider Hong Kong as a good place to surf !'),

It really only comes alive (like the rest of the Shonan Coast) in the summer and early fall months during the typhoon season.  Basically it neads a sizable swell directly from the South or South Southwest generated by a typhoon or other low pressure system in the Philipine Sea.  Do your homework before you go.  This is too long of a drive to check it on a whim.  If all the other spots on the Shonan Coast are firing or closing out, Sakawa may be worth a look.  It can be packed during smaller days, but when its huge the crowd thins out real quick.  It turns into a real serious wave when it gets overhead, and if your not an experienced surfer stay on the beach.  Its a rivermouth wave so it breaks both left and right. Both are great.  During a typhoon swell the wave is fast, hollow and powerful.  The right breaks just like Off the Wall.  You have time for one bottom turn and then pull in and enjoy the barrel.  If you are goofy foot, pull in and grab a rail right away.  Anything over 8 feet and you may not make all the sections.  The left is just as hollow and almost as quick, but you have more opportunity to make some moves. To the right of the break its deep, so you just have to time the shorepound to make it out.  Last time I was there we could park in the lot right on the beach.  If typhoon passage is to the east (prefered situation)the wind will be a strong offshore out of the north.  This tends to hold up the wave, and make the drop-ins vertical.  The water temp is warm enough during this time of the year that you can get by with trunks or a spring suit.<br><br>This spot can be as fun as Inamuragasaki on the right swell but less crowded than the other spots on the Shonan Coast.  Probably because of its driving distance and the intimidation factor of the wave itself.  During the last typhoon swell I surfed in Japan there was a crowd at all of the usuall ridable breaks on Shonan, so my bro Dave and I took a chance on Sakawa.  We had the spot to ourselves for a while, then we were joined by two profesional Japanese surfers (with photographers in tow) who were way cool to us.  Thats it, not another soul out.  Epic day!  That being said, I have been skunked by the swell gods on a few occaisions going there.<br><br>I love this spot because it is a challenging wave when its big and because of its relative isolation from the madness of the Shonan Coast.  Odawara and the Izu Peninsula are such a cool scene.  I have never been hassled by the locals.  The Japanese people are the most friendly and gracious people on the planet, but the folks in these parts are particulary nice to gaijin.  At least that was my experience.  Just remember that your in their house.  Treat them and their place with respect and you will make friends.  And if the break is not firing, keep heading south along the peninsula and discover one of the many &quot;secret&quot; breaks for yourself.  Kambate!\r\n  \r\n  This spot has become highly localized since the Dane/John John/Yadin photo/video shoot for surfing magazine. It''s also the spot where Yadin injured his ankle.
